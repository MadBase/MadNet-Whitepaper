    \caption{This plot shows how the specified rate of return will be
        multiplied by to show the actual rate of return.
        The maximum return occurs when the tokens in the tranche are
        released at one-half of the number of blocks they were originally
        held.
        This would occur because the system requires a large supply
        of tokens.}
