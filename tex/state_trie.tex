\section{StateTrie}

The StateTrie is a Compact Sparse Merkle Trie that tracks two types of
information.
First, the StateTrie immutably tracks all deposits that have been spent in an
append only manner.
These deposits are stored at the location of their UTXOID with a value that is
equal to the hash of the UTXOID itself.
The presence of such an object in the StateTrie implies that a deposit has been
spent.
The existence of a deposit that is valid for consumption is determined by the
Deposit smart contract on the Ethereum Blockchain.

The second piece of information the StateTrie tracks is the total set of all
unspent UTXO objects at a given height.
For every UTXO that exists in the blockchain, there is a single entry in the
StateTrie.
This entry is stored at the key that is equal to the UTXOID of the UTXO and the
value is the hash of the UTXO object.
When a UTXO is spent, the associated key value pair is removed from the current
trie.
