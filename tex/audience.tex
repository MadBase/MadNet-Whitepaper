\section{Audience}

This paper is intended for consumption by individuals that have a
non-introductory understanding of blockchain systems.
Although the best effort has been made to allow the contents of this
paper to be communicated in a comprehensible manner, a full description
of all fundamental concepts has been omitted for brevity.
Thus, the reader should understand the general operation of blockchain
systems.
Specifically, the reader should be familiar with UTXO-based systems
such as Bitcoin and account-based systems such as Ethereum.
A complete understanding of cryptography is not necessary for the main
body of this document, but an understanding of digital signatures is
required.
Knowledge of cryptographic hash functions is assumed.
Further, the reader should be aware of threshold cryptosystem capable
signatures such as BLS~\cite{boneh2001short}.
The academic treatment of these operations has been left for the
technical appendices.
